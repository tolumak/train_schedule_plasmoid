Train Schedule is a Plasmoid intended to run with KDE SC 4.4.

It allows the user to get information about the schedule of the SNCF (french train
company) trains: departure, delays, etc. It relies on the SNCF "Prochain DÃ©parts" widget
HTTP servers and may not function properly if information given by these servers change.
